## Objectives
The main objective of this project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Google Play Store app market and to answer the following questions:

1. Identify the category/genre with more installs than others.
2. Identify the pros and cons of paid apps.
3. Identify the relationship between variables.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about apps in the Google Play Store. The dataset includes information such as app category, app size, price, ratings, installs, and revenue.

### Data Processing and Analysis
To answer the research questions, the following analysis was conducted:

1. To identify the category/genre with more installs than others, the top 1000 installed apps in the Google Play Store were analyzed using category and genre analysis. The scope was then expanded to the entire market beyond the top 1000, and the competition in each category was analyzed by comparing the number of installs with the number of apps per category.

2. To identify the pros and cons of paid apps, a pie chart of paid/free apps in the entire market was created. Box plots were used to show installs that paid apps are missing and the estimated revenue they are generating. In addition, the project attempted to figure out if certain categories are more likely to show a high percentage of paid apps.

3. To identify the relationship between variables, the characteristics of highly-rated apps were analyzed by identifying the relationship between price, app size, and rating. The relationship between reviews and installs was also analyzed in detail through drawing lmplot. A linear regression model was used to determine the exact relationship by making predictions.

## Results
The results of the analysis showed that certain categories and genres get more installs than others. The competition in each category was also analyzed by comparing the number of installs with the number of apps per category. The analysis also revealed the pros and cons of running paid apps, and certain categories were shown to have a higher percentage of paid apps. Finally, the characteristics of highly-rated apps were identified by analyzing the relationship between price, app size, and rating, as well as the relationship between reviews and installs.
In this project, we analyzed the Google Play Store app market using EDA and visualizations. The project was successful in identifying meaningful relationships between different variables such as app category, app size, price, ratings, installs, and revenue. The findings from this project can be useful for app developers and marketers in making decisions regarding app development and monetization.
